# Description:

  In this project, the website developed was based on selecting a dog by breed to seach Cleveland area animal shelters that are open to adoption, including dog name, dog picture, city, phone number, and e-mail. It outputs "not available" if one of the search results is not available. Click on the image to learn more about each pet. 

# Project Creation Process:

  The HTML page was created and styled using bootstrap, css, and media queries to be mobile responsive. Javascript was written using jQuery which made ajax petfinder and wikipedia API get calls to display dog breed description, pics, and other descriptions on screen dynamically. Timer, bootstrap modal pop-up window, and spinner javascript were used as well.
