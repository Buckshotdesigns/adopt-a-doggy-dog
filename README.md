# ProjectOne

# Description:

In this project, a website is developed that based on dog breed selected, outputs 4 Cleveland area animal shelter search results that are open to adoption, including dog name, dog picture, city, phone number, and e-mail. It outputs "not available" if one of the search results is not available.

# Project Creation Process:

html page was created and sytled using bootstrap, css, and media queries to be mobile responsive. javascript was written using jQueries which made ajax petfinder and wikipedia API get calls to display dog breed description, pics, and other descriptions on screen dynamically. Timer, bootstrap modal pop-up window, and spinner javascript were used as well.
