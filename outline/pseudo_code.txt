		clear results box (id = "results")

		if text box is empty (id = "text_box")

			display modal message that the text box is blank (id = "pet_description")

		else	send api get request to pet finder (in ajax statement)

			send api get request to wikipedia to get pet description (in ajax statement)

			if there is no result from pet finder api

				display "no results found" (id = "pet_description")

			else display pet description from wikipeida to id = "pet_description"

			     if there are more than 8 results

				  output first 8 pictures of pets, names, shelter names, addresses, and phone numbers into (id = "results")
